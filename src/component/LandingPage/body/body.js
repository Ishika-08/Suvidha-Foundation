                    <p className="flex justify-center px-64 py-8 text-sm" >Our mission is to break the cycle of poverty, illiteracy, and low expectations through service and education. We mobilize U.S. students to transform our communities through service and change the world by building schools in developing countries.</p>
                    <p className="flex justify-center px-64 py-8 text-sm" >Service is at the heart of everything we do. From America’s underserved urban neighborhoods to the world’s economically poorest rural villages, we empower people to take on the most pressing issues in their communities through direct action. It’s not about what we do for the students and families we serve with, but what they do for their communities, our world, and themselves.</p>
