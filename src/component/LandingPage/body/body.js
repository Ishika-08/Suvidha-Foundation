                    <p className="flex justify-center px-64 py-8 text-sm" >Our mission is to break the cycle of poverty, illiteracy, and low expectations through service and education. We mobilize U.S. students to transform our communities through service and change the world by building schools in developing countries.</p>
                    <p className="flex justify-center px-64 py-8 text-sm" >Service is at the heart of everything we do. From America’s underserved urban neighborhoods to the world’s economically poorest rural villages, we empower people to take on the most pressing issues in their communities through direct action. It’s not about what we do for the students and families we serve with, but what they do for their communities, our world, and themselves.</p>

                <p className="font-bold text-sm">we are providing free coding courses for child that can't affort the high prices of education .so support us in our journey. At the entrance of Arti’s house in Uttarakhand, accolades make up quite an impressive collection. The 16-ye  ar-old proudly holds a certificate in her hand. She has won the school level essay competition in her State. Such accolades and recognition did not come easy for Arti. Her father, Surendra Singh, who runs a small shop in the village, deterred his daughter’s dream to study. With his mind set on prioritising his sons’ education over hers, it became a huge roadblock for Arti to realise her dreams. World Vision India, which worked in her community, came forward to support Arti’s education. </p>

                <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold py-2">Factors Influencing Learning Outcomes Among Children</h1>
                <p className="font-bold text-sm">While the data on absenteeism is challenging to obtain, there is a reasonable correlation between regular attendance and learning outcomes. The question is – what motivates children to attend school regularly? The challenges that present themselves are multi-faceted, including extrinsic and intrinsic factors. While some extrinsic factors like the Mid-Day Meal (MDM) programme is a reasonable incentive to ensure an increase in enrolment and attendance, lack of other infrastructure factors like access to schools, lack of/absence of sanitation facilities, safe drinking water, playgrounds, insufficient and under-equipped classrooms and teaching aids, etc., contribute to high dropout rates and poor learning outcomes.</p>
                <br/>
                <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold py-2">Extrinsic Factors</h1>
                <p className="font-bold text-sm">Pedagogical learning spaces that are inclusive, safe, healthy, and child-friendly are some extrinsic motivating factors prompting children to be regular in schools and create an environment conducive to learning. A study by the World Bank correlated how poor infrastructure could result in poor learning outcomes among children. For instance, separate toilets for boys and girls are essential. However, there is enough evidence, predominantly from rural areas, that girls would give their classes a miss if sanitary facilities were non-existent. The obstacles are even more evident in the hinterlands, with most schools having inadequate teaching staff and teaching aids. A single teacher handling a multi-level set of students is not an uncommon sight in many schools. Furthermore, some children walk or cycle several kilometres to attend school because of the lack of schools within their villages. The long-distance exhausts the young learners and discourages many from being regular, as safety becomes a matter of concern, especially for the girls.</p>
